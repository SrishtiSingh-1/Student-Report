# Student-Report

A simple console-based application developed in C++ that manages student report cards. This system allows users to add, display, search, and delete student records. It uses file handling to ensure data persistence.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Add a new student record with details like Roll Number, Name, and Marks in Mathematics, Science, and English.
- **Display Students**: View all student records, including total marks and percentage.
- **Search Student**: Search for a student by their roll number to view detailed information.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student's record using their roll number.
- **File Persistence**: Records are stored in a file (`reportcard.txt`), ensuring data is saved even when the program is closed.
